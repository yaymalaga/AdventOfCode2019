## About
When I discovered AoC, I saw an incredible oportunity to start ironing Rust after a slowly read of The Book. 
As a new beginner to the language, I'm still fighting the compiler and learning about the owership, so these experiments are helping a lot!  

Most of the code is not optimize, so you can expect to fine really weird algrithms. You are now warned ;)
